# Sync System for LI Instance
# ============================================================================
#
# IMPORTANT: The sync system is BUILT INTO synapse-li
#
# The synapse-li repository contains the sync implementation:
# - synapse-li/sync/sync_task.py   - Main sync orchestration
# - synapse-li/sync/checkpoint.py  - Sync progress tracking
# - synapse-li/sync/lock.py        - Concurrent sync prevention
#
# Features:
# - Periodic sync via synapse-li's built-in scheduler
# - Manual sync trigger via synapse-admin-li button
# - File lock prevents concurrent syncs
# - Checkpoint tracking for sync status
#
# NO ADDITIONAL DEPLOYMENT IS NEEDED for sync functionality.
# Sync is part of the synapse-li deployment (01-synapse-li/).
#
# Configuration:
# - Sync interval: Configured in synapse-li's settings
# - Manual sync: Button in synapse-admin-li interface
#
# Media:
# - Media sync is NOT needed - LI uses main MinIO directly via S3 API
#
# Database Sync Method:
# - pg_dump/pg_restore for full database synchronization
# - LI database is writable (for password resets)
# - Password changes are overwritten on next sync
#
# ============================================================================
#
# This file is intentionally minimal - the sync system is part of synapse-li.
# See LI_IMPLEMENTATION.md in the project root for implementation details.
